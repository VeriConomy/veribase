Release Process
====================

## Branch updates

### Before every release candidate

* Update manpages, see [gen-manpages.sh](https://github.com/VeriConomy/veribase/blob/master/contrib/devtools/README.md#gen-manpagessh).
* Update release candidate version in `configure.ac` (`CLIENT_VERSION_RC`).

### Before every major and minor release

* Update version in `configure.ac` (don't forget to set `CLIENT_VERSION_RC` to `0`).
* Write release notes (see "Write the release notes" below).

### Before every major release

* On both the master branch and the new release branch:
  - update `CLIENT_VERSION_MINOR` in [`configure.ac`](../configure.ac)
  - update `CLIENT_VERSION_MINOR`, `PACKAGE_VERSION`, and `PACKAGE_STRING` in [`build_msvc/bitcoin_config.h`](/build_msvc/bitcoin_config.h)
* On the new release branch in [`configure.ac`](../configure.ac) and [`build_msvc/bitcoin_config.h`](/build_msvc/bitcoin_config.h) (see [this commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/742f7dd)):
  - set `CLIENT_VERSION_REVISION` to `0`
  - set `CLIENT_VERSION_IS_RELEASE` to `true`

#### Before branch-off

* Update hardcoded [seeds](/contrib/seeds/README.md), see [this pull request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7415) for an example.
* Update [`src/chainparams.cpp`](/src/chainparams.cpp) m_assumed_blockchain_size and m_assumed_chain_state_size with the current size plus some overhead (see [this](#how-to-calculate-m_assumed_blockchain_size-and-m_assumed_chain_state_size) for information on how to calculate them).
* Update `src/chainparams.cpp` chainTxData with statistics about the transaction count and rate. Use the output of the RPC `getchaintxstats`, see
  [this pull request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17002) for an example. Reviewers can verify the results by running `getchaintxstats <window_block_count> <window_last_block_hash>` with the `window_block_count` and `window_last_block_hash` from your output.
* Update `src/chainparams.cpp` nMinimumChainWork with information from the getblockchaininfo rpc.
* Update `src/chainparams.cpp` defaultAssumeValid with information from the getblockhash rpc.
  - The selected value must not be orphaned so it may be useful to set the value two blocks back from the tip.
  - Testnet should be set some tens of thousands back from the tip due to reorgs there.
  - This update should be reviewed with a reindex-chainstate with assumevalid=0 to catch any defect
     that causes rejection of blocks in the past history.
- Clear the release notes and move them to the wiki (see "Write the release notes" below).

#### After branch-off (on the major release branch)

- Update the versions.

## Building

### Write the release notes

For the period during which the notes are being edited on the wiki, the version on the branch should be wiped and replaced with a link to the wiki which should be used for all announcements until `-final`.

Write the release notes. `git shortlog` helps a lot, for example:

    git shortlog --no-merges v(current version, e.g. 0.19.2)..v(new version, e.g. 0.20.0)

(or ping @wumpus on IRC, he has specific tooling to generate the list of merged pulls
and sort them into categories based on labels).

Generate list of authors:

    git log --format='- %aN' v(current version, e.g. 0.20.0)..v(new version, e.g. 0.20.1) | sort -fiu

Tag the version (or release candidate) in git:

    git tag -s v(new version, e.g. 0.20.0)

### Additional information

#### How to calculate `m_assumed_blockchain_size` and `m_assumed_chain_state_size`

Both variables are used as a guideline for how much space the user needs on their drive in total, not just strictly for the blockchain.
Note that all values should be taken from a **fully synced** node and have an overhead of 5-10% added on top of its base value.

To calculate `m_assumed_blockchain_size`:
- For `mainnet` -> Take the size of the data directory, excluding `/regtest` and `/testnet3` directories.
- For `testnet` -> Take the size of the `/testnet3` directory.


To calculate `m_assumed_chain_state_size`:
- For `mainnet` -> Take the size of the `/chainstate` directory.
- For `testnet` -> Take the size of the `/testnet3/chainstate` directory.

Notes:
- When taking the size for `m_assumed_blockchain_size`, there's no need to exclude the `/chainstate` directory since it's a guideline value and an overhead will be added anyway.
- The expected overhead for growth may change over time, so it may not be the same value as last release; pay attention to that when changing the variables.
